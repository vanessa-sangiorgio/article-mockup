#My reflection about:

##What new skills have you learned?


I've learned new Html file like Superscript, hr and del.

##What has been easy?

Select the different paragraph and understand the DOM.

##What has been difficult?
Find all the different format from the mockup like italics, bold and the superscript.

##How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I've understood that having fun in what I'm doing and _don't get anxious_ for new HTML element are the better way to overcome challenges.
